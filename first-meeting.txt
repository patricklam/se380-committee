Hi all,

Thanks for agreeing to serve on this committee. I've made some materials
available at the following page; I can also give you access to write to the
page as needed.

In particular, I have syllabi for SE 380 and MATH 213 (somewhat dated;
newer ones welcome) as well as AMATH 250 (from this Spring's
offering).  The "other-resources.txt" includes student notes from MATH
213 as well as a link to the page for S. Keshav's book _Mathematical
Foundations of Computer Networking_, from which you can look at the
table of contents. I've also added some thoughts from John Thistle.

It might be useful to look at the notes for SE 380 as well. Chris has
shared them with me but I don't feel like they are mine to share.

The way I see it, here are the potential directions in which we could
go:

1) modify SE 380 to ensure that it's accessible to CS students after taking AMATH 250;
2) modify MATH 213 and make it available to CS students;
3) stick with the status quo, after convincing ourselves that CS students can indeed
take SE 380 with a reasonable chance of success.

I'd like to schedule a meeting for next week. Please fill out this Doodle poll
with your availability. If you are not available, please send me your thoughts
by email.

I look forward to hearing from you!

PS it would also be good to have a CS student rep on this committee, e.g. a master's
student who has recently graduated from Waterloo CS.
